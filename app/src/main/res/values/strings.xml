        <item>Welcome to Android application development! This class teaches you how to build your
            first Android app. You\â€™ll learn how to create an Android project and run a debuggable
            version of the app. You\'ll also learn some fundamentals of Android app design, including
            how to build a simple user interface and handle user input.</item>

        <item>The action bar is one of the most important design elements you can implement for your
            app\'s activities. It provides several user interface features that make your app
            immediately familiar to users by offering consistency between other Android apps. </item>

        <item>Android devices come in many shapes and sizes all around the world. With a wide range
            of device types, you have an opportunity to reach a huge audience with your app. </item>
